Hiya! I’m Matthew!!!

My work sits at the intersection of **systems engineering, mathematical modelling, and computational methods**. I’m interested in how theoretical guarantees, algorithmic structure, and low-level systems design interact to produce software that is both correct and scalable.

I tend to approach engineering problems with a research mindset: build simple invariants, reason formally when possible, validate empirically when necessary, and prefer architectures whose performance characteristics are predictable rather than accidental.

Fun-fact about me: I was permitted double marticulation at both Edinburgh University and KCL concurrently to major in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science and to minor in Computer Science at one point.

## About Me

I’m a CS student focused on strengthening the fundamentals that high-assurance systems depend on:

- **Analysis, discrete mathematics, and optimization theory**  
- **Algorithm design and complexity considerations**  
- **High-performance computing and parallel models of computation**  
- **Systems software, compilers, and backend architectures**  

My engineering bias is toward designs that admit analysis.  
If a system can be reasoned about — in terms of correctness, latency, or scaling behaviour — then it’s worth building.

## Research Interests

- **High-performance computing**: memory hierarchies, vectorisation, cache-efficient algorithms  
- **Computational finance** and numerical methods for stochastic processes  
- **Numerical linear algebra**, solvers, preconditioners, and stability considerations  
- **Programming languages and type systems** with a focus on correctness and semantics  
- **Distributed systems**, event-driven architectures, and disciplined concurrency  
- **Optimization**: gradient-based methods, convexity, discrete optimisation  
- **Mechanism design & algorithmic game theory**  

I enjoy problems that require both mathematical structure and systems intuition.

## What I’m Working On

- Numerical and optimisation-focused projects aligned with computational finance  
- Architecture and implementation of **event-driven job queue systems** with well-defined concurrency semantics  
- Exploration of **clean IR design**, DSL tooling, and compiler-like abstractions  
- Software patterns for building predictable, analysable backend systems  
- Modelling projects involving ODE/PDE behaviour and numerically sensitive computations

## Languages & Tools

I work primarily with:

- **Python** — scientific computing, numerical methods, backend systems  
- **C++** — performance-oriented computation, data-structure engineering  
- **Scala**, **Kotlin**, **Java**, **C#** — practical systems development  
- **OCaml** — semantics, correctness, and principled abstraction  
- **SQL**, **Django**, **FastAPI** — structured, maintainable service design  

I prefer minimalism in the dependency graph and clarity in the invariants.  
Systems should be debuggable by construction.
